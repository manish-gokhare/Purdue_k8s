🧹 **Understanding `--cascade=false` in `kubectl delete`**

When you run:

```bash
kubectl delete rs my-rs1 --cascade=false
```

You're telling Kubernetes to **delete the ReplicaSet (`my-rs1`) but leave its dependent Pods untouched**. Normally, when you delete a ReplicaSet, Kubernetes also deletes all the Pods it created. This is called **cascading deletion**.

🔍 **What Does `--cascade=false` Do?**

- **Disables cascading deletion**.
- **Only deletes the parent object** (in this case, the ReplicaSet).
- **Leaves child objects** (like Pods) running in the cluster.

This can be useful if:
- You want to keep the Pods alive temporarily for debugging or migration.
- You're manually managing the Pods and don't want them deleted automatically.
- You're cleaning up old ReplicaSets but want to preserve the running Pods.

---

📌 **Important Notes**
- The Pods will remain, but they’ll be **orphaned**—no controller will manage them.
- You can still delete the Pods manually later using `kubectl delete pod`.

🧪 **Quick Example**

```bash
kubectl get rs
# Output: my-rs1 with 3 replicas

kubectl delete rs my-rs1 --cascade=false
kubectl get pods
# Output: The 3 pods created by my-rs1 are still running
```
