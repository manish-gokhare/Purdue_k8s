üè∑Ô∏è What Are Labels?
Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (including Pods). They‚Äôre used for:

Organizing and categorizing Pods (e.g., by app name, environment, version)

Selecting Pods for operations like deployment, monitoring, or traffic routing

Grouping Pods logically even if they‚Äôre physically on different nodes

YAMl- Declare pod with label

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
    tier: frontend
    env: staging

```
