🧭 **What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?**  
A **namespace** in Kubernetes is like a virtual cluster within your physical cluster.
It helps organize and isolate resources such as Pods, ReplicaSets (RS), Services, and Deployments. 
Think of it as a way to divide your cluster into logical partitions for better management, especially when multiple teams or 
environments (like dev, staging, prod) share the same infrastructure.

📦 **How Namespaces Work**  
- Each namespace contains its own set of Kubernetes objects.
- Resources inside a namespace are **isolated** from those in other namespaces.
- You can apply **resource quotas** and **access controls** per namespace.
- Namespaces are only applicable to **namespaced objects** (e.g., Pods, Services, Deployments), not cluster-wide objects 
(e.g., Nodes, PersistentVolumes).

🛠️ **Example: Creating a Namespace and Deploying a Pod**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev-environment
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: dev-environment
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

This creates a namespace called `dev-environment` and deploys an `nginx` pod inside it. 
You can do the same for ReplicaSets, Services, and Deployments by specifying the `namespace` field.

🔗 **Relation to Other Kubernetes Objects**

| Object       | Namespace Scope | Description |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Pod          | ✅ Yes            | Runs inside a namespace and isolated from others. |
| ReplicaSet   | ✅ Yes            | Manages pod replicas within a namespace. |
| Deployment   | ✅ Yes            | Controls ReplicaSets and Pods in a namespace. |
| Service      | ✅ Yes            | Exposes Pods within the same namespace. |
| Node         | ❌ No             | Cluster-wide resource, not tied to any namespace. |
| PersistentVolume | ❌ No         | Shared across namespaces. |

🎯 **Why Use Namespaces?**
- **Environment Segregation**: Separate dev, test, and prod workloads.
- **Team Isolation**: Different teams can manage their own resources independently.
- **Security & Access Control**: Apply RBAC policies per namespace.
- **Resource Management**: Set quotas to prevent resource hogging.

kubectl get ns

Default namespace is "default".

To work in islate environment environment. We need to create ns.
hadoop-ns
db-ns
kafka-ns
monitoring-ns
